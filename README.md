## API Personal Finances

API I'm building to control my personal finances.

The main problem I intend to solve is controlling several bank accounts and credit cards, carrying out automated reconciliation.

The idea of using this as an API is that I can connect to multiple fronts. As my focus now is on the business rule, I don't need to worry about building a web page, I can display the data in a spreadsheet.
